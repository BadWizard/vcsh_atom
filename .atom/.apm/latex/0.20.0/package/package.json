The only current officially supported distribution is\n[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), but [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) has\nbeen reported to work.\n\nYou need to ensure that the package can find your TeX distribution; if you're\nusing TeX Live and have installed to the default location then no further\naction is required. To help the package find the distribution's binaries, you\nneed to configure the *TeX Path* configuration variable to point to the folder\ncontaining the binaries. This can be done either in the settings view, or\ndirectly in your `config.cson` file.\n\n## Usage\nInvoke the `build` command by pressing the default keybind `ctrl-alt-b` while in\na `.tex` file.\n\n## Status\nPlease note that this package is in a **beta** state. Right now everything is\nvery naÃ¯ve. As an example, there's no real error handling; the package merely\nprints an error message to the console indicating that an error occurred during\nthe build, and to check the log file manually...\n\n## TODO\nCurrent wish list, in a semi-prioritized order.\n\n- [x] Progress indicator.\n- [ ] Build output.\n - [x] Error handling.\n - [ ] Warnings, and other non-critical messages.\n- [ ] BibTeX autocompletion support.\n- [x] Open PDF automatically.\n - [x] Configurable.\n - [x] Support for other distributions, besides OS X.\n- [ ] Support for compilers other than latexmk.\n - [ ] Add support for non-PDF typesetting (e.g. dvi).\n- [ ] Project management.\n - [ ] Setting to override the output directory.\n - [ ] Setting to override the builder.\n\nIf you see something that's missing, or disagree with the prioritization,\nconsider submitting a [feature request](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues?labels=feature&state=open),\nand if you're feeling super helpful, submit a pull request with an updated\nTODO list :sparkling_heart:\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex","_id":"latex@0.20.0","_shasum":"35488e1bb85d4cef05e39a1502953e28045309bf","_resolved":"file:../d-115221-1006-nostfz/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115221-1006-nostfz/package.tgz"}
